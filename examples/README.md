# Examples

A collection of examples for the elm-collision library

- Circles: Simple circle collision
- Rectangles: Simple rectangle collision
- RectangleSide: Detect which side of a rectangle is colliding


### Run an Example

Let's say you want to see the results of `Circles.elm`. You would run the
following two commands:

```bash
elm-package install
elm-reactor
```

Then open `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` and select Circles.elm or open `http://0.0.0.0:8000/Circle.elm` directly in your browser!

You only need to run `elm-package install` once. That will grab the latest
released version of the `elm-collision` library.
